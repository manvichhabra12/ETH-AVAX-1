UniquePaymentManager Contract
The UniquePaymentManager contract manages payments and withdrawals with restrictions on payment amounts and owner-exclusive functions.

Overview
The contract allows users to make payments and the owner to withdraw accumulated payments. It also supports updating a donation limit for payments.

Contract Details
Owner: Stores the address of the contract deployer (owner).
TotalPayments: Tracks the cumulative total of all payments made to the contract.
Payments: Maps addresses to the amount of payments each address has made.
DonationLimit: Sets a default limit of 10 ether for individual payments.
Functions
1.constructor: Initializes the contract owner upon deployment.

2.makePayment
Visibility: External
Description: Allows any address to make a payment to the contract.
Requirements: Payment amount must be greater than 0 and not exceed the donationLimit.
Effects: Updates the payment mapping and increments totalPayments.

3.withdrawPayments
Visibility: External
Description: Allows the contract owner to withdraw accumulated payments.
Requirements: Only callable by the contract owner. Owner must have accumulated payments to withdraw.
Effects: Transfers the accumulated payment amount to the owner and resets the payment mapping.

4.updateDonationLimit
Visibility: External
Description: Allows the contract owner to update the donation limit.
Requirements: Only callable by the contract owner. New limit must be greater than 0.
Effects: Updates the donationLimit to the specified value.

5.getDonationLimit
Visibility: External view
Description: Retrieves the current donation limit.
Returns: The current donationLimit value.

Usage
1.Deployment
Deploy the contract to an Ethereum-compatible blockchain.

2.Interacting with the Contract
Use a wallet or script to interact with the contract:
Make payments using the makePayment function.
Withdraw accumulated payments using withdrawPayments (owner only).
Update the donation limit using updateDonationLimit (owner only).
Retrieve the current donation limit using getDonationLimit.

Security Considerations
Ensure that only the contract owner has access to critical functions like withdrawPayments and updateDonationLimit.
Validate user inputs to prevent unintended behavior or attacks.
Consider gas optimization and potential vulnerabilities such as reentrancy.
